# STM Python Code

This repository contains the python code from the `Open STM: A low-cost scanning tunneling microscope with a fast approach method` [paper](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/f35c6xzzcm/1). The python code is responsible for controlling the `ESP32` microcontroller that is in control of the STM. I have no association with the original authors and I in no way guarantee the correctness of the code. The code is provided as is and I am not responsible for any damage that may occur from using the code.
